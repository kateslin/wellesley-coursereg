# Wellesley College Course Registration Bot

Registration bot for Wellesley courses on Banner® by Ellucian System

To use, start running the script a few minutes before registration period. Once registration opens, press any key to automatically register. Note that the Wellesley registration system often crashes during the first five seconds, so it might be better to register 5-10 seconds after registration opens.

NOTE: Wellesley has switched from using the Banner system, so this bot is no longer useful for Wellesley course registration. However, other colleges using the Banner® by Ellucian System may find a modified version of this script useful
